# Assurity Consulting Test

The automated test have been implemented in [src/test/java/APITest.java](https://github.com/dkap937-209/Assurity_Test/blob/main/src/test/java/APITest.java).

CI has been setup to run the test each time a push is made to `main` branch.

To run this locally it will require [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) to be installed. 
The project can then be opened in IntelliJ and the test can be run.
